          <p>
            Thank you for your support and interest in Proto Bioengineering, LLC. We are so thankful to have you as a part of our community!
          </p>
          <p>
            Please review these Terms of Purchase very carefully.  By purchasing our products and/or services, you are agreeing to these and are expressing that you have been given reasonable access to review these terms prior to your purchase. These Terms are binding as of the date you purchase or access our products and/or services.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>General Purpose.</strong> These Terms are between you (“Purchaser,” “you,” “your”) and Proto Bioengineering, LLC, (“Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”) for the purpose of purchasing or otherwise obtaining digital products and/or services (our “Products”) whether through the Company’s websites at protobioengineering.com, protob.io, ko-fi.com/protobio, or any related domains or subdomains (the “Website”), or in person. The Company and the Purchaser will collectively be referred to as “Parties,” and each individually as a “Party.”
          </p>
          <p>
            By clicking “Add to Cart,” “Buy Now,” or any other phrase on the purchase button, submitting a payment electronically or in-person, or otherwise subscribing through the Website, you are agreeing to adhere to and be bound by following terms and conditions, together with the Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference ( the "Terms"):
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Scope of Products.</strong> Our Products include but are not limited to: digital downloads, templates, online courses, freelance services, tutoring services, digital books, printed books, study aids, tutorials about engineering and software development, masterclasses, masterminds, and workshops.
              </li>

                <strong>Product Delivery.</strong> When you make a purchase and submit your payment, you will be provided with the Products as detailed on the Website and/or as you selected prior to purchase. Please note that product delivery will differ based on when you make your purchase and if it is a digital or physical product. For more information, please refer to the product description and your receipt of purchase delivered by email, e.g. if you purchase tutoring services or the like, where the service may be rendered at a later, specified date.  If the Product is listed as presale or pre-order, the order will be delivered as detailed on the Website. The Company will make all reasonable efforts to meet any estimated delivery dates. Should the Company be unable to meet estimated timelines for delivery of presale Products, the Company will have the sole discretion as to whether to issue a refund.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Product Disclaimer.</strong> You understand and agree that the content included in any of the Products is merely meant to be informational in nature and does not represent any level of legal, medical, financial, or other professional industry-specific advice. As such, our Company will not be responsible for any damages that result from the use of the Products.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Warranties + No Guarantees.</strong> We are providing the Products on this Website on an “As-Is” basis for individual use by you at your own risk and without any warranties, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to warranties of title; merchantability; fitness for a particular use; or any rights or licenses in these Terms.  The Company makes no warranty as to the accuracy and reliability of information set forth in the Products, the Website, and Company-related documentation.  You understand and agree that purchasing the Products does not guarantee specific results, including financial or other business gains for you personally and/or for the business. The information included in the Products is provided for informational purposes only and you are responsible for implementing any business practices or suggested actions found within these Products.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Geographic Limitations.</strong> You understand and agree that the Products may not be suitable for your state, country, or jurisdiction and agree that you are solely responsible for finding a licensed attorney in your area to review and modify the Products to adhere to your state, country, or jurisdiction’s specific laws.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Payment + Billing.</strong> By providing the Company with your preferred payment method, you represent that you: (i) are authorized to use, and (ii) authorize the Company to charge that payment method (the “Authorized Payment Method”) for any fees related to your purchase of the Products, including without limitation fees relating to any paid feature of the Website and/or subscription service of the Company in which you have chosen to enroll (collectively, the “Fees”). If you are taking advantage of any limited time trial-period offer and you do not cancel the service on or before the last day of the trial period, you are authorizing us to charge your payment method for the service. Unless otherwise indicated, all Fees are in USD.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Return Policy.</strong> If our Products did not meet your needs and you have followed the conditions in this section, we are willing to offer a 31-day return policy. Refunds can be requested by emailing the Company at “protobioengineering@gmail.com”. If granted, refunds will be issued from the Company’s payment processor, Stripe, and not our online shop vendors, such as Tindie or Ko-fi.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Subscriptions + Subscription Cancellations.</strong> When you purchase any Products on an ongoing subscription basis (for example: weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually), you are authorizing the Company to process incurred and recurring Fees until the subscription is terminated and all outstanding fees have been paid in full. You must keep a valid Authorized Payment Method on file with the Company.  Recurring payments are billed in advance at 30-day intervals (each, a “Billing Date”). If we are unable to successfully process a payment of the Fees using your Authorized Payment Method, we will make a second attempt to process payment 2 days later, then we will make a final attempt 5 days following the second attempt if it is unsuccessful. If the final attempt is unsuccessful, we reserve the right to suspend or revoke your subscription until all current and outstanding Fees are paid. If outstanding Fees remain unpaid for 90 days following the suspension date, the Company reserves the right to refer your account to collections. The Purchaser has 30 days to notify the Company of any issues with recurring payments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You are required to complete all payments for the subscription period you committed to at purchase. At the end of the subscription period, the subscription service will auto-renew on a monthly basis and may be cancelled at any time in writing. If any payment is returned unpaid or the payment method is rejected during the subscription period, the Company or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable fees as permitted by law. If you fail to make any payment on time and fail to correct such missed payment within 30 days, or if you fail to make any 3 payments on time, the Company is permitted to cancel your participation in the program by providing written notice at the email address provided by you. Upon cancellation, you agree and promise to pay the Company a cancellation fee as damages equal to (i) the amount of any missed payments, plus (ii) 50% of the remaining amounts due under the Agreement. The cancellation fee is due immediately, and the Company is authorized to use any credit card or bank account on file to collect such fee. The Company will have no further obligations to perform under these Terms following cancellation.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Chargebacks.</strong> By attempting a chargeback with your financial institution, you are expressly agreeing to pay the full cost of your original purchase, plus any fees or associated costs incurred by the Company. We have the right to present these Terms to your financial institution, any payment processing company and/or investigating agency concerning the attempted chargeback or financial dispute.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Promotions + Discounts.</strong> We may occasionally market and/or advertise promotions, discounts, limited time offers, and/or bonuses (“Promotions”) to potential customers.
